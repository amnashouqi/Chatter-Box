1. minor fixes like msg overflow vertically below the typing part, padding - done 
2. I need a user placeholder image thing for the user. 
3. Save it to the db
4. Sign in/sign up for user and store in db
5. add a navigator column kinda thing in the left to access any past chats from the db
6. Dark version and light version
7. stored user name instead of random ID 
8. Dont repeat the user name if its the same user who msged last
9. by default the last message should be visible lowering the need to scroll
